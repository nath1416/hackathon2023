They label it racist when people suggest that out of control immigration is causing part of the housing problem. Or racist when people ask that far less focus be put on native issues when there are so many other issues which could change the very course of our country.\n\nTo spend time on drag events instead of healthcare? I suspect people in the drag community would choose healthcare as the higher priority.\n\nSome issues aren't either/or, but things like healthcare, housing, debt, and inequality have reached crisis proportions and thus should be getting 100% of the attention possible from the top levels of government."

I mean, I'm not an economist, but to keep people at home and trying to slow the spread of a disease that wreaked global havoc is gonna be expensive. Shoulda just shut everything down and not helped financially. That would've helped prevent a crash for sure. Everyone knows being proactive is cheaper than picking up the pieces right?\n\nAnd then people seem to forget that a few provinces requested/begged/demanded funds \"for healthcare\". When the federal government requested that it only be used for healthcare, and some data points related to healthcare, the provinces threw a tantrum. \n\nFood for thought, but why would the federal government increase CHT 10% when the provinces just totally refuse to fund it on their end, especially after a couple years of increase in emergency funding that wasn't used accordingly?\n\nI don't know why someone brought up the gun buyback.

Any surplus will be accepted and processed into long lasting preservable and shelf stable items such as hard cheese and processed cheese. In times of plenty instead of sending cash as foreign aid we send our cheese and help feed the needy. This would apply domestically as well, those under a certain income bracket could collect cheese, powdered milk and butter as a social benefit combating domestic hunger. Then during times of scarcity those products could be brought into the standard market to balance it out and prevent prices from rising is much (like 3 times a year). Instead of paying for the over production, the contributing farmers would get a tax credit of some kind and because we use that for foreign aid, we have more money in our pockets domestically.  My proposal is very similar to the US Government cheese program, without as much warehoused surplus by substituting the processed milk products where cash would generally be used in international aid situations. People could be using the milk instead of it being dumped and there would be no reason for 3 hikes a year."

They are selling their services,  just like everyone else selling their services. It is up to the buyer to do their own due dilligence.\n\nFor some reason, too many people accept they should be shopping at the top of their capabilities.
